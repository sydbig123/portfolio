            <p class="lead in">Hello! I am Sydney Biggar, a graduate of The Pennsylvania State University ('24). In December 2024 I 
                received my Bachelor's degree in Human-Centered Design and Development (HCDD), with a focus in Psychology, along with 
                a minor in Psychology. HCDD is a combination of software development and human-computer interaction (HCI). My background 
                in coding, HCI, and psychology enables me to design, build, and test intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing applications.

            <h2>Organizations</h2>
            <p class="in">During my senior year (2023-2024), I participated in THON as a <b class="fw-bold">Rules & Regulations Committee Member</b>. THON is a student-run 
                philanthropy that raises funds for pediatric cancer research in addition to providing emotional and financial support to families affected by pediatric cancer.
                As a Rules & Regulations Committee Member I assisted in signing people on and off the event level during THON Weekend and ensured that spectators
                in the stands followed fire safety regulations. In addition to this role, I served as the <b class="fw-bold">EMS Specialist</b> for my committee. This entailed
                educating my fellow committee members on what to do in the event of a medical emergency. Unfortunately, during THON weekend a medical emergency did occur in my
                committee's section while we were on shift. However, I can proudly say that the members of my committee handled the emergency very well and remembered how to 
                properly manage the situation.</p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of school and programming, I enjoy reading, baking, and watching movies. I am also a big animal lover and enjoy making art, especially painting. </p>
