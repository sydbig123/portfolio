        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Sydney Biggar. I am a student at The Pennsylvania State University with an
            intended graduation of December 2024. I am working towards my bachelors degree in Human-Centered Design and Development (HCDD)
            as well as a minor in Psychology. Currently, I am looking for an internship for summer 2024.
        </p>

        <h2>Organizations</h2>
        <img class="rightPhoto sydney" src="./images/thonGroupPhoto.JPEG" alt="Image Sydney's 2024 THON Committee">
        <p>During my senior year (2023-2024), I participated in THON as a <strong>Rules & Regulations Committee Member</strong>. THON is a student-run philanthropy
        that is raises funds for pediatric cancer research while also providing emotional and financial support to those affected by pediatric cancer.
        As a Rules & Regulations Committee Member I assisted in signing people on and off the event level during THON Weekend and ensured that spectators
        in the stands followed fire safety regulations. In addition to this role, I also served as the <strong>EMS Specialist</strong> for my committee. This entailed
        educating my fellow committee members on what to do in the event of a medical emergency. Unfortunately, a medical emergency occurred while
        my committee was on shift during THON Weekend. However, I can proudly say that all the members of my committee handled the emergency very well and remembered how to properly
        manage the situation.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of school and programming, I enjoy reading, baking, and watching movies. I am also a big animal lover and enjoy making art, especially painting. </p>
