            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Trash2Treasure is an application that can be used to locate Recycling Centers, learn
                about the recycling policies of specific Recycling Centers, learn how to properly recycle,
                and track your recycling habits. Our application targets users who are looking to track how
                much they recycle and/or become more environmentally friendly by learning how to recycle
                properly. </p>

            <h2>Site Map</h2>
            <img class="diagram" src="documents/trash2treasure/UXMap.drawio.png" alt="Site Map">
            <p>Our design approach began with a focus on our use cases, where we thought about how to organize them logically. We began by sketching out a layout for the home screen, and looking for the essential elements that should be there. Once we had a clear vision for the home page and navigation bar, it became simpler to group the information according to how we wanted our design to be structured. We decided to put distinct buttons on the home bar for each section, allowing users to easily access various parts of the app. For example, the navigation bar of our app would consist of the main functions: User Profile, Locate Center, How to Guide, Waste-Saved Progress, and Social. Within these sections, we placed the specific functions that belonged to each area. In the User Profile section the user will be able to manage general and security preferences as well as sign in and out. In the Locate Center section the user will be able to search the map in various ways and view details about each center such as if they are able to receive financial compensation there. The How to Guide screen will start with the user manually searching  for an item or scanning an item. The next screen will provide steps for the user to follow to correctly throw out their item. The Waste-Saved Progress section is where the users rewards will be tracked and where they can find their recycling points and “Impact on environment.” Finally, the Social section is where the users can compete with one another in points and see updates on their friends’ status. This grouping approach ensures that users can navigate through the app with ease as each section and its contents are logically organized and accessible.</p>

            <h2>User Flow Diagram</h2>
            <img class="diagram" src="documents/trash2treasure/HCDDFlow.png" alt="Flow Diagram" id="flow">
            <p>This user flow model begins with the user creating an account or logging into their existing account. After the user successfully logs in, they will be brought to the app’s home page. At the bottom of this page (along with all the app’s pages besides the login and sign up pages), the user is able to access the navigation bar that can lead the user to any of the following pages: Home, Scan, Map/Guide, Social, and Profile. </p>

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>If my group and I were to move forward with this project, we would make the
                following edits to our project before continuing with user-testing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure the entire application uses the elements, styles, and fonts listed
                    in the Style Guide that we made</li>
                <li>Make button areas larger and ensure all buttons are in places where they
                    will not be overlooked by users</li>
                <li>Create more visual feedback within the application for successful and
                    unsuccessful actions</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
